# ruby.nvim

Ruby development plugin for Neovim. Highly unstable.

# Motivation

This is a personal exercise on moving features from [go.nvim](https://github.com/npxbr/go.nvim/) to ruby world, using latest features from Neovim. The idea is to try to use Lua as much as possible, without relying
100% on Ruby 3rd party libs. Of course, some of them will still be needed, but
the focus is to push Lua the most we can.

# Disclaimer

That is totally based on [go.nvim](https://github.com/npxbr/go.nvim)
